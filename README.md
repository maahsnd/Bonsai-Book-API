# Bonsai Book PHP

# Impetus

This is the initial implementation of a still nascent idea. At its core, Bonsai Book is simple: a searchable database of actual trees, with standardized 
categorical information. Bonsai Book is intended to address a need: it would be helpful for bonsai practitioners, especially new ones such as myself, to 
have examples that they can refer to. Similarly, it is rewarding for practitioners to share their work, and gather feedback. This exists, but not in a 
dedicated, standardized format. Currently, practitioners might post their bonsai to reddit, or to a dedicated forum site, like Bonsai Nut. These sites 
are very generalized, and can not be easily searched for actual bonsai, serving instead as communication spaces for enthusiasts.
